## Code sample

> Please provide a link to a piece of code that you feel represents your interests and ability. This code can take a variety of forms, e.g. a pull request, a repo, a piece of code within a repo, etc. The goal is to see how you structure and express your ideas in code. If you cannot share a particular sample due to it being proprietary, please link to a write up or video discussion of that work with as much context as you can provide.

[This code sample](https://github.com/shotover/shotover-proxy/blob/1fca835cb547a5b14a354fac34e8c4cdfba4d52d/shotover/src/message/mod.rs) is one of the core data types of the database proxy I work on at my current job.

The code here isn't doing anything particularly complex or interesting itself.
However I find it interesting, since it's a critical point through which many distinct systems in the proxy interact with each other.
The abstraction allows messages to be parsed into an AST on demand, caching the AST and allowing the AST to be modified and encoded as the final message before it goes onto the socket.
I don't feel it is the best possible solution, in particular maybe we could find a way to introduce type safety to ensure modifying the message's AST automatically invalidates the cache instead of having to [manually call a method](https://github.com/shotover/shotover-proxy/blob/1fca835cb547a5b14a354fac34e8c4cdfba4d52d/shotover/src/message/mod.rs#L325) but it is a pragmatic solution that drastically improves over what we had before.

I designed and orchestrated its implementation in [this issue](https://github.com/shotover/shotover-proxy/issues/445).
I think you should give the issue a quick look as it explains the problems this design solved over the previous implementation.
And gives insight into how we incrementally made changes to arrive at this design without interrupting development occurring in other areas.

Alternatively, if you want some code with lots of logic, there is the [KafkaSinkCluster](https://github.com/shotover/shotover-proxy/blame/7cafcd856744fabbecf714086a44ea292576f453/shotover/src/transforms/kafka/sink_cluster/mod.rs) transform.
Transforms in shotover are chained together by the user to configure the proxy, messages flow between transforms.
KafkaSinkCluster is a sink transform, meaning it is the last transform in the chain, and is responsible for actually sending the messages to the destination DB.
The code contains logic for:

* Determine which node in the kafka cluster to route each message to.
  * To facilitate this shotover keeps track of the state of each node node in the cluster.
* Rewrite messages that refer to kafka IP addresses to use shotover IP addresses instead. Otherwise clients will start connecting to the real cluster bypassing the proxy.

With software we are usually able to just take a path and then if it turns out we took the wrong trade off, try another path.
Of course foundational decisions like choosing a programming language are incredibly difficult to redo.
We can always revisit a trade-off in software, but we are then trading off time. And sometimes we cant afford the time.
Below I'll discuss a trade off within a tradeoff, some of it can be revisited, some of it cannot.

I needed to write realistic integration level benchmarks that spin up AWS EC2 instances.
To achieve this I needed to decide on an abstraction for interacting with AWS.
I looked into tools like terraform but I didn't like:

* keeping track of instances in a file stored locally on disk.
  * If a developer loses that file they will have to manually track down and destroy the created resources.
* dependencies external to cargo that wont be pulled in automatically when running `cargo build`.

So I built an abstraction on top the official [rust-aws-sdk](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust) called [aws-throwaway](https://github.com/shotover/aws-throwaway).
It has no local storage and instead relies entirely on AWS tags to clean up the instances.

However after writing some benchmarks around it I discovered that it had destroyed the build times of our benchmarks.
The `aws-sdk-ec2` crate has the worst warm and cold compile times of any crate I've ever seen due in part to its large number of auto-generated types and functions.
Fixing this upstream seemed out of scope for me, there are already multiple full-time AWS engineers working on this sdk.
It was clear to me that depending on the official SDK was a mistake, at least in its current state.
So instead I added a backend to `aws-throwaway` to [avoid the sdk crate and instead just shell out to the AWS CLI](https://github.com/shotover/aws-throwaway/pull/41)

But taking another step back, maybe I should not have written `aws-throwaway` at all.
It took significant engineering investment to build up this crate.
And we still need to occasionally extend the crate when we encounter missing functionality.
That said, there are many unknowns in what a solution based on an existing IaC tool would look like, we would certainly need at least some kind of rusty wrapper to shell out to the tool and automatically destroy resources after the bench finishes.
However since we can just add features to `aws-throwaway` as we need them, swapping away from `aws-throwaway` does not seem worth it at this point.

From an open source perspective, I think `aws-throwaway` is neat and I can see it being used in various areas if it were discovered.
From a personal perspective I learnt so much from building it.
But from the perspective of furthering my teams goals by empowering developers to write benchmarks it would have been more time effective to just build something on top of an existing IaC tool.
